ControlFreak is a small crowd control assist addon.
It provides a small frame for fast click-casting of CC spells onto the player's focus target.
It also provides visual cues of the focus's status and audio cues of CC breaks.

ControlFreak is designed to be an "install and go" addon for all classes with sustainable CC spells,
but it also provides direct access to edit the macro used by the frame for players that want to extend it's functionality.

For users who want a macro instead of clicking on the frame, put this code into a new macro and drop it in your actionbar:<br>
@/click ControlFreakFrame@
